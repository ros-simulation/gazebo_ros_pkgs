Changelog for package gazebo_ros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2.9.2 (2021-04-21)
------------------
* Only subscribe to /gazebo/performance_metrics when necessary (`#1202 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1202>`_)
  We are currently subscribing to the /gazebo/performance_metrics topic
  even if there are no subscribers to the ROS topic forwarding this data.
  The link_states and model_states topics currently use an advertise
  mechanism with callbacks when a subscriber connects or disconnects,
  so I've used that same pattern for the performance_metrics topic.
  This also helps workaround the deadlock documented in `#1175 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1175>`_ and
  `osrf/gazebo#2902 <https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/issues/2902>`_.
  This also adds a GAZEBO_ROS_HAS_PERFORMANCE_METRICS
  macro that reduces duplication of the version checking logic for
  performance metrics in gazebo and adds fixes some doc-string and
  typos in existing code
* [Noetic] Bridge to republish PerformanceMetrics in ROS (`#1145 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1145>`_)
  Co-authored-by: Ian Chen <ichen@osrfoundation.org>
* delete request msgs (`#1160 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1160>`_)
* gazebo_ros_api_plugin cleanup (`#1137 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1137>`_)
  Remove an unused overload of publishSimTime and add doxygen
  for the remaining publishSimTime function.
  * Remove duplicate code for /clock advertisement
  The /clock topic is advertised in both loadGazeboRosApiPlugin
  and advertiseServices. This removes the code from advertiseServices
  and moves it earlier in loadGazeboRosApiPlugin.
  Co-authored-by: Alejandro Hernández Cordero <ahcorde@gmail.com>
* colcon.pkg: build gazebo first in colcon workspace (`#1135 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1135>`_)
  Add a colcon.pkg file to gazebo_dev with gazebo's cmake project
  name "Gazebo" listed as a dependency to support building
  gazebo from source in a colcon workspace.
  * Add colcon.pkg files for other packages
  Copy colcon.pkg to gazebo_ros, gazebo_plugins, and
  gazebo_ros_control so that --merge-install won't be required.
