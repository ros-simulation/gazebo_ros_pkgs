* colcon.pkg: build gazebo first in colcon workspace (`#1135 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1135>`_)
  Add a colcon.pkg file to gazebo_dev with gazebo's cmake project
  name "Gazebo" listed as a dependency to support building
  gazebo from source in a colcon workspace.
  * Add colcon.pkg files for other packages
  Copy colcon.pkg to gazebo_ros, gazebo_plugins, and
  gazebo_ros_control so that --merge-install won't be required.

  instead.
  The functionality is still available through the SetParam API.
  cherry-picked from indigo-devel
  Add ifdefs to fix build with gazebo2
  It was broken by `#315 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/315>`_.

  DefaultRobotHWSim::initSim() member function uses both
  namespaced NodeHandle and robot_namespace string to create

  DefaultRobotHWSim tries to get parameters from following names:
  - /rrbot/rrbot/gazebo_ros_control/pid_gains/*
  - /rrbot/rrbot/joint_limits/*
  This commit change these names to:
  - /rrbot/gazebo_ros_control/pid_gains/*
  - /rrbot/joint_limits/*

------------------

2.3.5 (2014-03-26)
