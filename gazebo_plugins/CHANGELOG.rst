Changelog for package gazebo_plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2.9.2 (2021-04-21)
------------------
* gazebo_ros_utils: don't set tf_prefix if empty (`#1173 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1173>`_)
  Similar changes were made in `#1143 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1143>`_ to address `#554 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/554>`_,
  but this class wasn't included.
* Update test worlds to use the correct element names for xyzOffset and rpyOffset (`#1206 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1206>`_)
  The test worlds add an extra 's' character, but the real names are singular.
* [noetic][planar_move_controller] add cmdTimeout param (`#1133 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1133>`_)
  Co-authored-by: Alejandro Hernández Cordero <ahcorde@gmail.com>
* [noetic][Windows] Removing extra CameraPlugin header inclusion from gazebo_ros_camera_utils (`#1161 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1161>`_)
* multi roboti example updated for noetic (`#1154 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1154>`_)
* Leave empty tf_prefix values unset (`#1143 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1143>`_)
  As reported in `#554 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/554>`_, tf_prefix has been long deprecated,
  so if it is unset, leave it empty instead of giving a default value.
  Fixes `#554 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/554>`_.
* Added directives if profiler is not installed (`#1144 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1144>`_)
* colcon.pkg: build gazebo first in colcon workspace (`#1135 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1135>`_)
  Add a colcon.pkg file to gazebo_dev with gazebo's cmake project  name "Gazebo" listed as a dependency to support building
  gazebo from source in a colcon workspace. Add colcon.pkg files for other packages
  Copy colcon.pkg to gazebo_ros, gazebo_plugins, and  gazebo_ros_control so that --merge-install won't be required.
* [Noetic] Added Ignition common profiler to gazebo_plugins (`#1139 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1139>`_)
  * Added Ignition common profiler
  * Fixed typo
* WheelSlip.cfg: ignore default parameter values (`#1126 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1126>`_)
  The WheelSlipPlugin already has default values for the slip
  compliance parameters, so ignore the default values set in
  WheelSlip.cfg by making them negative and instruct the
  callback to ignore negative values.
  Also, ignore the `level` variable in callback so that
  parameters set in launch file will not be ignored.

* Fix sensors after time reset (lunar-devel) (`#705 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/705>`_)
  * camera plugin keeps publishing after negative sensor update interval
  World resets result in a negative time differences between current world
  time and the last recorded sensor update time, preventing the plugin

2.5.9 (2017-02-20)
------------------
* Fix gazebo catkin warning, cleanup CMakeLists (`#537 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/537>`_)
* Fix timestamp issues for rendering sensors (kinetic-devel)
* Namespace console output (`#543 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/543>`_)
* Adding depth camera world to use in test to make depth camera have right timestamp `#408 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/408>`_- appears to be working (though only looking at horizon) but getting these sdf errors:
* `#408 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/408>`_ Make the multi camera timestamps current rather than outdated, also reuse the same update code
* Fix merge with kinetic branch
* `#408 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/408>`_ Making a test for multicamra that shows the timestamps are currently outdated, will fix them similar to how the regular camera was fixed.
* Fix for issue `#408 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/408>`_. The last measurement time is the time that gazebo generated the sensor data, so ought to be used. updateRate doesn't seem that useful.
  The other cameras need similar fixes to have the proper timestamps.
* Bugfix: duplicated tf prefix resolution
* fill in child_frame_id of odom topic
* Fix gazebo and sdformat catkin warnings
* Contributors: Dave Coleman, Jose Luis Rivero, Kei Okada, Lucas Walter, Yuki Furuta

  Covariance for published twist in skid steer plugin
* gazebo_ros_utils.h: include gazebo_config.h
  Make sure to include gazebo_config.h,
  which defines the GAZEBO_MAJOR_VERSION macro
* Fix compiler error with SetHFOV
  In gazebo7, the rendering::Camera::SetHFOV function
  is overloaded with a potential for ambiguity,
  as reported in the following issue:
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1830
  This fixes the build by explicitly defining the
  Angle type.
* Add missing boost header
  Some boost headers were remove from gazebo7 header files
  and gazebo_ros_joint_state_publisher.cpp was using it
  implicitly.
* Fix gazebo7 build errors
  The SensorPtr types have changed from boost:: pointers
  to std:: pointers,
  which requires boost::dynamic_pointer_cast to change to
  std::dynamic_pointer_cast.
  A helper macro is added that adds a `using` statement
  corresponding to the correct type of dynamic_pointer_cast.
  This macro should be narrowly scoped to protect
  other code.
* gazebo_ros_utils.h: include gazebo_config.h
  Make sure to include gazebo_config.h,
  which defines the GAZEBO_MAJOR_VERSION macro
* Use Joint::SetParam for joint velocity motors
  Before gazebo5, Joint::SetVelocity and SetMaxForce
  were used to set joint velocity motors.
  The API has changed in gazebo5, to use Joint::SetParam
  instead.
  The functionality is still available through the SetParam API.
  cherry-picked from indigo-devel
  Add ifdefs to fix build with gazebo2
  It was broken by `#315 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/315>`_.

------------------
* update test world for block laser
* this corrects the right orientation of the laser scan and improves on comparison between 2 double numbers
* Initialize ``depth_image_connect_count_`` in openni_kinect plugin
* multicamera bad namespace. Fixes `#161 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/161>`_

* Contributors: Dejan Pangercic, Ian Chen, John Hsu, Jordi Pages, Toni Oliver, Ugo Cupcic

2.3.4 (2013-11-13)
------------------
* rerelease because sdformat became libsdformat, but we also based change on 2.3.4 in hydro-devel.
* Simplify ``gazebo_plugins/CMakeLists.txt``
  Replace ``cxx_flags`` and ``ld_flags`` variables with simpler cmake macros
  and eliminate unnecessary references to ``SDFormat_LIBRARIES``, since
  they are already part of ``GAZEBO_LIBRARIES``.
* Put some cmake lists on multiple lines to improve readability.
* Add dependencies on dynamic reconfigure files
  Occasionally the build can fail due to some targets having an
  undeclared dependency on automatically generated dynamic
  reconfigure files (GazeboRosCameraConfig.h for example). This
  commit declares several of those dependencies.

2.4.0 (2013-10-14)
------------------

2.3.3 (2013-10-10)
------------------
* gazebo_plugins: use shared pointers for variables shared among cameras
  It is not allowed to construct a shared_ptr from a pointer to a member
  variable.
* gazebo_plugins: moved initialization of shared_ptr members of
  GazeboRosCameraUtils to `GazeboRosCameraUtils::Load()`
  This fixes segfaults in gazebo_ros_depth_camera and
  gazebo_ros_openni_kinect as the pointers have not been initialized
  there.
* Use `RenderingIFace.hh`

2.3.2 (2013-09-19)
------------------
* Make gazebo includes use full path
  In the next release of gazebo, it will be required to use the
  full path for include files. For example,
  `include <physics/physics.hh>` will not be valid
  `include <gazebo/physics/physics.hh>` must be done instead.
* Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of `gazebo_ros_pkgs <github.com:ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs>`_ into synchronize_with_drcsim_plugins
* change includes to use brackets in headers for export
* per pull request comments
* Changed resolution for searchParam.
* Don't forget to delete the node!
* Removed info message on robot namespace.
* Retreive the tf prefix from the robot node.
* synchronize with drcsim plugins

2.3.1 (2013-08-27)
------------------
* Remove direct dependency on pcl, rely on the transitive dependency from pcl_ros

2.3.0 (2013-08-12)
------------------
* enable image generation when pointcloud is requested, as the generated image is used by the pointcloud
* gazebo_plugins: replace deprecated boost function
  This is related to this `gazebo issue #581 <https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issue/581/boost-shared_-_cast-are-deprecated-removed>`_
* gazebo_plugins: fix linkedit issues
  Note: other linkedit errors were fixed upstream
  in gazebo
* gazebo_ros_openni_kinect plugin: adds publishing of the camera info
  again (fixes `#95 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/95>`_)
* Merge pull request `#90 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/90>`_ from piyushk/add_model_controller
  added a simple model controller plugin that uses a twist message
* renamed plugin from model controller to planar move
* prevents dynamic_reconfigure from overwritting update rate param on start-up
* removed anonymizer from include guard
* fixed odometry publication for model controller plugin
* added a simple model controller plugin that uses a twist message to control models

------------------
* Added prosilica plugin to install TARGETS

2.2.0 (2013-07-29)
------------------

* fixed node intialization conflict between gzserver and gzclient. better adherance to gazebo style guidelines
* Fixed template
* removed ros initialization from plugins
* Standardized the way ROS nodes are initialized in gazebo plugins
* Remove find_package(SDF) from CMakeLists.txt
  It is sufficient to find gazebo, which will export the information about the SDFormat package.
* ROS Video Plugin for Gazebo - allows displaying an image stream in an OGRE texture inside gazebo. Also provides a fix for `#85 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/85>`_.
* patch a fix for prosilica plugin (startup race condition where `rosnode_` might still be NULL).
* Added explanation of new dependency in gazebo_ros_pkgs
* switch Prosilica camera from type depth to regular camera (as depth data were not used).
* migrating prosilica plugin from pr2_gazebo_plugins
* Removed tbb because it was a temporary dependency for a Gazebo bug
* SDF.hh --> sdf.hh
* Added PCL to package.xml

2.1.5 (2013-07-18)
------------------
* Include <sdf/sdf.hh> instead of <sdf/SDF.hh>
  The sdformat package recently changed the name of an sdf header
  file from SDF.hh to SDFImpl.hh; this change will use the lower-case
  header file which should work with old and new versions of sdformat
  or gazebo.

2.1.4 (2013-07-14)
------------------

2.1.3 (2013-07-13)
------------------

2.1.0 (2013-06-27)
------------------
* gazebo_plugins: always use gazebo/ path prefix in include directives
* gazebo_plugins: call Advertise() directly after initialization has
  completed in gazebo_ros_openni_kinect and gazebo_ros_depth_camera
  plugins, as the sensor will never be activated otherwise
* Merge pull request `#41 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/41>`_ from ZdenekM/hydro-devel
  Added skid steering plugin (modified diff drive plugin).
* Merge pull request `#35 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/35>`_ from meyerj/fix_include_directory_installation_target

  The tf_prefix param is published under the robot namespace and not the
  robotnamespace/camera node which makes it non-local we have to use the
  robot namespace to get it otherwise it is empty.
* findreplace ConnectWorldUpdateStart ConnectWorldUpdateBegin
* Fixed deprecated function calls in gazebo_plugins
* Deprecated warnings fixes
* Removed the two plugin tests that are deprecated
